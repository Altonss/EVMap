<h2>FAQ about the price comparison feature</h2>
 
<h3>Where does the pricing data come from?</h3>
<p>The pricing information is available in EVMap thanks to the service from our friends at <a href="https://chargeprice.app">Chargeprice.app</a>.
    The data shown within EVMap are identical to those on the Chargeprice website, the developer of EVMap has no direct influence
    on this data and assume no liability for their correctness.</p>
<p>The calculated total charging cost is an estimate based on the selected vehicle model and the desired state of
    charge, so it should only be considered as an approximate value. The exact cost depends on many factors
    (e.g. reduced charging power with a cold battery, additional consumption through charging loss or heating/cooling
    during charging, etc.), which Chargeprice cannot foresee.</p>

<h3>How can I report incorrect data?</h3>
<p>If you find an incorrect price, a missing provider, or have questions about the pricing data, you can contact the
    Chargeprice team directly on their <a href="https://chargeprice.app">website</a>.</p>

<h3>How are the charging plans sorted?</h3>
<p>The plans you have selected as "my charging plans" in EVMap's settings will be shown at the beginning of the list
    and with a gray background. All other plans are sorted by the estimated total charging cost in ascending order.</p>

<h3>Why are some charging plans highlighted with a different background color and include a provider logo or a coupon code?</h3>
<p>Certain providers have partnered with Chargeprice to promote their services. If you tap on a plan from such a
    provider to check out further information on the provider's website, Chargeprice receives a small payment.
    If you do this through the EVMap app, these payments will be deducted from the fees that the developer of EVMap needs
    to pay for using the Chargeprice data. So, checking out the services of Chargeprice's partners benefits both
    Chargeprice and EVMap.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Chargeprice is committed to maximum transparency â€” all plans will still be sorted by price, independent
    of whether the provider is a partner or not.</p>
    
<h3>Why is the estimated charging power at AC chargers lower than what my car supports?</h3>
<p>Some European countries with three-phase electricity grids have restrictions on so-called unbalanced loads, i.e. appliances pulling
    a lot of power from a single phase. If your car's onboard charger does not support two- or three-phase charging, this limitation may apply
    to your car as well at AC stations. For example, in Germany the limit for unbalanced loads is 20&nbsp;A, which corresponds to about 4.5&nbsp;kW.
    However, not all public charging stations actually enforce this limit. To calculate prices based on the maximum power your car
    supports, use "Enable unbalanced load" in the app's settings.</p>
