<h2>Permissions</h2>

The following permissions are needed by EVMap:
 
<h3>Internet access</h3>
<p>Needed to load information about charging stations from the internet.</p>

<h3>Location access while running in the foreground</h3>
<p>Needed to show your current location on the map and load charging stations nearby.
	This permission is <b>optional</b>, since Android 6.0 you can decide if EVMap can access your
	exact (GPS) or approximate (WiFi/mobile network) location or none at all.</p>
<p>The Android Auto and Android Automotive OS apps are not usable without the location permission, because
	it always shows nearby charging stations.</p>
<p>The app only accesses your location when running in the foreground - starting with Android 10 this is also
	enforced by the system (a separate permission would be needed for background access)</p>

<h3>View network and WiFi connections</h3>
<p>Used e.g. by the Google Maps and Google Places libraries to check if there is an internet connection
	and to adapt their data usage to the type of connection (mobile data or WiFi).</p>
	
<h3>Special permissions for Android Auto and Android Automotive OS (only Google Play version)</h3>
<p>The Android Auto and Android Automotive OS apps need the following additional permissions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Access vehicle data (e.g. vehicle GPS)</li>
	<li>Run foreground service (to use the smartphone's GPS in case the vehicle does not provide this data)</li>
	<li>Android Car App Library Map Templates (to display the user interface using the templates provided by Android Auto)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Google Play Billing service (only Google Play version)</h3>
<p>To support in-app purchases for donations via Google Play</p>
